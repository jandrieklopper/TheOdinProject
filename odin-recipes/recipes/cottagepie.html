    <li> ¼ cup butter, softened</li>
        
    <li>¼ pound shredded Cheddar cheese</li>

</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and carrot; cook and stir until onion has softened, about 5 minutes. Mix in flour, Italian seasoning, and cinnamon. Stir in parsley.</li>
    <li>Combine beef broth and tomato paste together in a jug; add to beef mixture. Season with salt and pepper; lower heat and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, place diced potatoes in a medium saucepan; cover with water and place over high heat. Bring to a boil and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes; drain. Mash potatoes until smooth, then add milk and butter; whip until fluffy. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Spoon ground beef mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish; spread mashed potatoes on top and sprinkle with grated Cheddar cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven until top is browned and cheese is bubbly, about 25 minutes.</li>
